					The very chief sentence that Imran Khan, the prime minister-in-waiting, uttered in his victory speech on July 26 was: 
					When I came into politics, I wanted Pakistan to become the kind of country that our 
					leader Muhammad Ali Jinnah wanted.<br><br>

					He said his inspiration was Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), “the city of Medina that he founded, how it was based on humanity. For the first 
					time, the state formed was based on humanitarianism.”<br><br>

					That is my inspiration, that Pakistan should have that kind of humanitarian state, where we take responsibility for our weaker classes, 
					he added looking straight into the camera.<br><br>
					
					“Now, if we want to make this great State of Pakistan happy and prosperous, we should wholly and solely concentrate on the well-being of 
					the people, and especially of the masses and the poor… no matter what is his colour, caste or creed, (he) is first, second and last a 
					citizen of this State with equal rights, privileges and obligations.<br><br>

					“We should begin to work in that spirit and in course of time all these angularities of the majority and minority communities, the Hindu 
					community and the Muslim community, because even as regards Muslims you have Pathans, Punjabis, Shias, Sunnis and so on, and among the 
					Hindus you have Brahmins, Vashnavas, Khatris, also Bengalis, Madrasis and so on, will vanish.

				Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) launched their campaign for General Elections 2018 from Karachi with former  
				chief minister Shehbaz Sharif promising to cure all ills faced by the city of lights.<br><br>
				
				Speaking to an audience of businessmen at the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FPCCI) on Monday, Shehbaz 
				hailed Karachi as the most profit generating city. “Karachi is the biggest port city – it is the financial hub, the nerve of exports 
				yet the political and military governments have failed to give the city its due status.”
